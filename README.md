<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project aims to explore the capability of GNNs applied on data flow graphs (DFGs) and control data flow graphs (CDFGs). 
It also provides a standard dataset of (C)DFGs for further explorations of different GNN models.


## Dataset

### Synthetic data
* Synthetic programs in C language are generated by [ldrgrn](https://github.com/gergo-/ldrgen).

* Generate synthetic basic blocks:
```sh
frama-c -ldrgen -ldrgen-stmt-depth 1 -ldrgen-expr-depth 3
```
* Generate synthetic C programs with control signals (e.g., loop and branch):
```sh
frama-c -ldrgen -ldrgen-stmt-depth 1 -ldrgen-expr-depth 3
```


### Real-case data

We currently consider three mainstream benchmarks in HLS to build our real-case CDFGs.

* [PolyBench/C](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~pouchet/software/polybench/)
* [CHStone](http://www.ertl.jp/chstone/)
* [MachSuite](https://github.com/breagen/MachSuite)
